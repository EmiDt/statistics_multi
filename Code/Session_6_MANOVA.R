### non parametric MANOVA in the case of strong deviations from normality
library(ICSNP)
rank.ctest(as.matrix(soil_fin) ~ soil_dat4$Cat_)

## robust MANOVA 
# see http://www.statistik.tuwien.ac.at/public/filz/papers/09CSDAmanova.pdf 
# for a paper on robust MANOVA by Peter Filzmoser. 
# In general, Peter Filzmoser provides many papers on robust statistical methods using R
# http://file.statistik.tuwien.ac.at/filz/papers/09CSDAmanova.pdf
# the classical, robust and rank-based MANOVA with the Wilk test statistic
# can be conducted using:
# Wilks.test {rrcov}

## MANOVA using RDA
# first step would be checking for homogeneity of covariance matrices
# has already been done above
manov_rda <- rda(soil_fin ~ soil_dat4$Cat_)
summary(manov_rda)
# explained variance of factor is 6.2 %
anova(manov_rda, step =1000, perm.max=1000)
# result similar to Manova - but a permutation test is used
summary.manova(manov) # only for comparison

# the RDA context offers the opportunity of plotting
par(cex=1.5)
# plot variables
plot(manov_rda, scaling=3, display=c("sp"), xlim=c(-1.5,2), ylim=c(-1.5,2.2))
# plot centroids of factors
text(manov_rda, display="cn", scaling=3, labels= c("A", "B", "C", "D"), col = c("green", "red", "light blue", "orange"))
# add individual sites
wa_sc <- scores(manov_rda, display="wa", scaling=3)
text(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="A" , ], col="green", labels = row.names(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="A", ]))
text(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="B" , ], col="red", labels = row.names(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="B", ]))
text(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="C" , ], col="light blue", labels = row.names(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="C", ]))
text(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="D" , ], col="orange", labels = row.names(wa_sc[soil_dat4$Cat_=="D", ]))
# shows that centroids of all factors are close to overall centre
# spread of A and B higher

#  Exercise  #
##############
# Conduct a MANOVA for the glass data set.
# Do the glass vessels originate from different manufacturers?
# use ?glass to obtain more information on the data
# conduct a RDA on the groups as well and visualise the results.

library(chemometrics)
## data preparation
data(glass)
data(glass.grp)
# the data is extremely uneven in terms of sample size
# we only choose the groups with relatively even sample size
# and only a few variables

glass_dat <- glass[glass.grp != 1, 1:5]
glass_grp <- factor(glass.grp[glass.grp != 1])
# you have to define glass.grp as factor
summary(glass_grp)
